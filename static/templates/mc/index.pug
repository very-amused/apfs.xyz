  h3 My Minecraft Server
  p I run a minecraft server, and it's yours as much as it is mine. It currently has a robust multiverse system (multiple worlds) and big plans for a bunch of fun worlds in the future. We already have a survival world, with plans for two more on the way. Open to anyone interested, just join using the IP <code class="text-white">mc.apfs.xyz</code>
  | If you aren't convinced yet, have a look at some screenshots...
  //- Carousel of MC Screenshots
  div(class="carousel slide" id="screenshotCarousel")
    div(class="carousel-inner")
      //- Iteration for screenshots 1-13
      each val in [...Array(13).keys()].map(i => i + 1)
        if val === 1
          div(class="carousel-item active")
            img(class="d-block img-fluid" src="/img/mc/resized/screenshot_" + val + ".png")
        else
          div(class="carousel-item")
            img(class="d-block img-fluid" src="/img/mc/resized/screenshot_" + val + ".png")
    //- Carousel controls
    a(class="carousel-control-prev" href="#screenshotCarousel" role="button" data-slide="prev")
      span(class="carousel-control-prev-icon")
    a(class="carousel-control-next" href="#screenshotCarousel" role="button" data-slide="next")
      span(class="carousel-control-next-icon")
  //- Start the carousel with a 3 second time between changing slides
  script.
    $('.carousel').carousel({
      interval: 3000
    });
